HAML/Sass Presentation

----- HAML

* use_template_engine :haml will still allow you to use erb. It just looks for
  haml first.
  
* {} contents: anything that returns a hash.

* [] shortcuts look useful. [object, what_to_prepend]. div[@user, :greeeting]

* ~ preserves whitespace. Useful with textareas.

* !!! for xhtml doctype

* Use [:ugly] mode for production since it's faster.

* Filters
  :javascript
    function foo() {
      alert("#{message[:notice]}")
    }

  %style
    :sass
      form
        font-size: 10px
        
  :markdown
    = @post.comment
  
----- SASS

* Sass syntax also accepts the colon behind the property, so these are 
  equivalent:
  h1
    :margin 5px
  h1
    margin: 5px
    
* Reusable CSS
  = spacing
    padding: 200px
    margin-top: 40px
  
  body
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif
    +spacing
    
  Useful to put these variables in a file that can be included and shared 
  across stylesheets.
