Tutorial: Learning Merb

----- Philosophy

* Main focus these days: fast, lightweight, powerful.

* Modular. For example, view helpers are not needed for a web service, so you
  should be able to pull those out.
  
* Agnostic. merb-core is agnostic, but by default you get DataMapper for ORM,
  RSpec for testing/specs.
  
* Gave a quick look at a model and controller.

----- App

* `merb-gen core` to build a core app
