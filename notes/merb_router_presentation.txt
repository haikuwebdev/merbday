Merb Router Presentation

* Match 3 simple route.

* Pass variables to match, pretty much just like Rails.

* Can use :subdomains as a hash key to match. Works well with single 
  subdomains, but with many (passed as an array) it can get a little ugly 
  because they get squashed together with a to_s.
